Development process for password encryption-

1) Run SQL script that contains encrypted passwords.
	- Modify DDL for password field, length should be 68.


2) Modify database properties file to point to a new database.
(We have to change jdbc.url property, We have to point to a new schema)

{noop} - No operation ( Plain text password )

{bcrypt} - Bcrypt password hashing


** What happens behind the scenes when user tries to login **

1) Retrieve the password from database for the user.

2) Read the encoding algorithm id. (bcrypt)

3) For case of bcrypt, encrypt plain text password from login form.
(Using salt from the database password)

4) Compare encrypted password from the login form with the encrypted
password from db.

5) If matches, Successful login.

6) If not, login failed.

(Bcrypt is one way algorithm, you can't decrypt the password)
